# POVChallengePlugin

This plugin is inspired by a video from [KOURÃ˜S](https://www.youtube.com/c/KOUROSRL): [FR] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA-hyjOKK-w

This plugin automatically adjust your camera's FOV:

- If you score, your FOV increases by 5.
- If you take a goal, your FOV decreases by 5.

At the end of the match, the FOV is reverted.

## /!\ This plugin only works for local matches /!\
